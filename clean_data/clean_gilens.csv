Opponents say that vouchers will not pay for the coverage Medicare now provides, so seniors will have to pay more or receive less coverage under this plan.

Medical Savings Accounts would allow employers to purchase plans with lower premiums that would only provide coverage after the employee pays about...$ 2,000 a year in medical bills. Any savings the employer gets by offering this less expensive plan could be put into the employee's tax-free medical savings account, which could be used to help pay the first...$ 2,000...in medical bills or any additional medical expenses. If it is not spent, it could be withdrawn as additional taxable income or saved to spend on next year's medical bills. Supporters of Medical Savings Accounts say this will lower individuals' health care costs because it would give individuals the incentive to spend their own money more carefully. They also say this would reduce hassle for people to go to a doctor of their own choice without getting the approval of the insurance company. Opponents say that because people would have to pay the first...$ 2,000...for doctor and hospital visits at the time they receive care, Medical Savings Accounts would discourage people from getting needed services and preventive care. They also say that because healthier people are more likely to sign up for Medical Savings Accounts, this would leave sicker people paying higher premiums.

Medical Savings Accounts would allow employers to purchase plans with lower premiums that would only provide coverage after the employee pays about...$ 5,000 a year in medical bills. Any savings the employer gets by offering this less expensive plan could be put into the employee's tax-free medical savings account, which could be used to help pay the first...$ 5,000...in medical bills or any additional medical expenses. If it is not spent, it could be withdrawn as additional taxable income or saved to spend on next year's medical bills. Supporters of Medical Savings Accounts say this will lower individuals' health care costs because it would give individuals the incentive to spend their own money more carefully. They also say this would reduce hassle for people to go to a doctor of their own choice without getting the approval of the insurance company. Opponents say that because people would have to pay the first...$ 5,000...for doctor and hospital visits at the time they receive care, Medical Savings Accounts would discourage people from getting needed services and preventive care. They also say that because healthier people are more likely to sign up for Medical Savings Accounts, this would leave sicker people paying higher premiums.

To solve that problem a federal advisory committee has come up with three different proposals to keep the retirement fund solvent. Would you please tell me whether you favor or oppose each of those plans. For example... the first plan would keep the current Social Security system as is, but it would have the government invest about forty percent of Social Security revenue in the stock market rather than in government bonds as is currently done.

To solve that problem a federal advisory committee has come up with three different proposals to keep the retirement fund solvent. Would you please tell me whether you favor or oppose each of those plans.) For example... the second plan would divide Social Security into two parts. The first part would have the Social Security system continue as a government program, but would guarantee a base monthly benefit of$ 410. The second part would take the rest of the money from each person's Social Security taxes and invest it in personal savings accounts that he or she chooses. The amount of the entire Social Security benefit that the individuals would receive when they retire would depend on how well or how poorly they invested in their personal savings account. To continue providing benefits to those who are already retired, the government would have to raise Social Security taxes under this plan by about 1.5%. Do you favor or oppose this plan?
